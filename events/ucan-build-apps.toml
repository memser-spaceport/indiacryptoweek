description = """
"web3.storage team is excited to show how content addressed user-centric protocols like IPFS, DID, and UCAN will change the web, and how to build Node.js applications using them.

The web3.storage team will share the latest APIs and walk you through building your own application data model. Start with DID-based self-sovereign auth, a great opportunity to learn about the next wave of digital identity, and write code to upload files as well as JSON objects.

We'll discuss IPFS data structures like IPLD trees and graphs, and how they can be used in applications, as well as walk you through setting up UCAN delegations to enable both user-pays and application-pays web3.storage account models.

Agenda:
- Web3 storage intro
- Discussion on use cases
- Interactive code-along workshop

Learn more about what the web3.storage team is building by visiting web3.storage and/or following @web3storage onÂ Twitter!"
