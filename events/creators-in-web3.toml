AÔªøbout the Host: Numbers Protocol
Numbers Protocol: The first asset-centric Web3 protocol to empower the creator economy and bring trust back to the internet.
Numbers Protocol is the first asset-centric protocol designed for the digital content industry and is also the library of digital media files. It supports the entire lifecycle of modern digital content ‚Äì from Web registration and decentralized storage to NFT minting and royalty sharing. With so much manipulation, theft, and censorship, Numbers Protocol makes the goal of bringing trust back to digital media a top priority.
Numbers Protocol has been successfully implemented in many relevant use cases, such as Reuters coverage of the 2020 US presidential election and in Ukraine cataloging and preserving the world‚Äôs first Web3 war crime evidence. Besides, Numbers Protocol is also the foundation of the Web3 creator economy. By making digital media traceable and verifiable, we will be able to address the core problems, including but not limited to Copyright, Ownership, Asset History, and Royalty Distributions.
