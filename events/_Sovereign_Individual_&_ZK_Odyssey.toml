Excitement for IOSG’s annual flagship event is at its peak as the Lisbon blockchain month is approaching!

Join the sovereign individual movement with the exploration in the spell of zero-knowledge with us in the 9th Old Friends Reunion, which will happen in Lisbon on Nov 1st, 2022, with the theme of Sovereign Individual & ZK Odyssey. Following the success of the 7th Old Friends Reunion — DeFi Summit 2020, 8th Old Friends Reunion-Scaling Summit and Metaverse Carnival 2021, we’re excited to initiate the trend each year, make in-depth conversation and gather the most visioners and professionals to bring value to the vibrant blockchain industry.

By inviting industry professionals and visioners to build a comprehensive and mindful discussion, OFR 2022 will navigate on the topics of Data, Privacy, DID, zkEVM, ZKPs, zkRollup, etc., featuring zero knowledge’s implementation of Blockchain and how to navigate cryptographic primitives as a buidler. Attendees will have a chance to listen to the mind-blowing panel discussions and keynote sessions in the fully engaged one-day event.
